# On writing and dealing with stress
Let me say that  I currently taking antidepressants and life now feels better for me. Not only interactions with people became more meaningful but also constant headaches are gone(kinda).   
I wrote a lot of journals into my desk as diaries, but they all will just disappear and vanish away. Time to go digital. 

Today I read in [hacker news](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/) that you can just write blogs about what you learned and what you build, that works for me. I also think will be cool to add things that you want to build, maybe someone else will build them faster than you :)

So projects that I wanna write posts about:
- How to break image generation AI sites
- What is better for backprop sum vs concat vs mult
- 2D pose estimation for human/fish/birds/excavators

This is my small list of blog posts that I will work on for now, to deal with pressure and anxiety. So I guess I work more to deal with stress, is it helpful? Maybe. But what are the other options? Just convince yourself that everything is fine, or think that everything is not fine and be anxious forever and never make anything done. I think the answer is obvious.
