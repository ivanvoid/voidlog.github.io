# Building wireless keyboard with QMK and Arduino parts (BLE, nRF)

## Motivation
**QMK** is flexible software that allow anyone to build custum keyboards.  
As far as I know QMK does't provide any wireless copabilities. If one want wireless usally ZMK used. But I have only some Arduino modules: 
- 2x bluetooth(BLE)
- 2x radio(nRF)
- 2x Arduino Pro Micto (ATmega32U4)  

So I desided to build maket of keyboard and try to write software lib that can carry this task.

## Hardware build
